Roger Blobaum has a bit of a cult following in Hollywood. He is depicted in a number of movies. One such movie is Signs by M. Night Shyamalan. Dr. Blobaum has a cameo in this movie as Dr. Bimbu, the author of the book on the aliens in the tin foil hat scene shown in the image above. 

There is a twist on the whole movie. It can be interpreted as a movie about organic versus GMO. The story of the family versus the aliens intent on eradicating humanity from within the corn. 

Dr. Bimbu predicts a grim future for the corn farming family with great accuracy to the tin foil hat community. Dr. Blobaum has been predicting this same thing for decades, all around America and the world. The aliens in Signs are Monsanto and Bayer intent on eradicating humanity from within the corn. The aliens come from the corn using a toxin. In real life this toxin is called glyphosate which is an herbicide that gets into the food supply in trace amounts, among others. Glyphosate has been causing a lot of trouble.  <a href="/usa/politics/2022/06/19/jeremy-grantham-warns-only-the-rich-will-procreate-as-chemicals-leave-the-poor-sterile.html">Jeremy Grantham predicts only the rich will procreate</a> as chemicals such as glyphosate left in trace amounts on the food are causing a chemical toxicity which is leaving people sterile. 

The key to victory comes from the homeland of the director which is India and the key is to use water. The use of water to defeat the aliens is a clue to the viewer to use water to defeat monsanto and bayer. In other words, wash your vegetables, especially if they are GMO! 

There is a speech about beliefs and 14 lights. Do you believe in organic or GMO? A lot of people who might review the movie Signs might say it is about beliefs. 14 lights are mentioned in one speech. 

Roger is retired now, and 93 years old, in the past he was one of the world's greatest organic activists.
