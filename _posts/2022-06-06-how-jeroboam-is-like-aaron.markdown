Aaron lead the people astray with the sex cult of the golden bull. 
Jeroboam lead the people astray with the sex cult of the golden bull. 

Aaron's sons are the Kohanim, Cohen, Kahn, Kahane, etc, families. 
Jeroboam's sons are the Bloombaum, Bourbon, Bimbo, Blobaum, Bumbu, Pompeo, etc, families. 

Aaron and his sons were conscripted to serve in the temple until the end of time as punishment.
Jeroboam and his sons were eradicated as punishment. 

Aaron and his sons were spared because they were related to Moses. 
Jeroboam and his sons were not spared because there were not related to Moses. 

Aaron's sons became the Cohen and the Kohanim the priestly caste of Judaism. 
Jeroboam sons all perished except the one that got away. 

There is an ancient custom that says when you eradicate a family you must let the youngest boy survive so as to not upset the Lord. 

Cohen is an owner of english and other prominent languages.
Jeroboam is an owner of english and other prominent languages. 

Aaron made the golden bull and then told everyone to go to bed. 
Jeroboam also made the golden bull and then told everyone his name which means increase the people.

The golden calf is like a boy taken from his mother and raised to fight a war by the nation. 
These boys are sacrificed in their youth for the good of the people. 
In the same way, a boy calf is eaten as veal at a young age, sacrificed so the people can have milk. 

Jeroboam faced off in a phony war with his dyslexic brother King Rosenbaum. 
Their plan was to divide and conquer after learning Egypt was summoning an army to re-enslave them with.
