If you follow astrology as closely as we do, you know you can learn a lot about someone based on their Zodiac sign—and that includes the members of the British royal family.

And since we’re currently in Prince Harry’s season (aka Virgo season), we decided to do a deep dive into some of our favorite royals’ signs. As it turns out, most of them are quite fitting.

### 1. QUEEN ELIZABETH
Zodiac sign: Taurus

We believe Taurus’s one word mantra “give” pretty much sums up why Queen Elizabeth fits this Zodiac sign. Taureans can use their materialistic tendencies for good by giving back to others. And who gives to their community more than Her Majesty?

### 2. PRINCE CHARLES
Zodiac sign: Scorpio

Like his mom, the Prince of Wales also fits his sign fairly well. Scorps are known to blaze their own trails and are considered the most fiery of all signs. Charles has remained passionate about all of his endeavors throughout his life, both royal and non-royal (especially when it comes to the environment and his art).

### 3. PRINCE WILLIAM
Zodiac sign: Cancer

When it comes to Cancers, its all about emotions and feelings. Those in this sign employ a deep well of empathy and are able to relate to the people (even animals) around them. Not to mention, they provide endless care and attention to others. Perhaps that’s why the Duke of Cambridge seems to form a connection with (and leave an impression on) everyone he meets.

### 4. PRINCE HARRY
Zodiac sign: Virgo

If there’s one thing we know about Virgos (such as the Duke of Sussex) it’s that they truly want the best for other people. Virgos are guided by altruism and are always looking for ways to make the world and others’ lives better. Sounds like Harry. According to Horoscope.com, “Practical Virgos are incredibly adept at big picture thinking, and planning out their life, their vacations, and what they’re going to do today isn’t a drag. It makes them feel in control and secure.” This fits the duke’s big picture thinking on the environment, as well as his family life away from the royal spotlight.

### 5. KATE MIDDLETON
Zodiac sign: Capricorn

Middleton is a Capricorn, and as such, she is perfectly suited for taking on a royal role. Caps are very career-focused. They’re known as the most ambitious and often make the best managers, CEOs and leaders (!). According to astrology writer Kiki O’Keeffe, “Their talent is in wrangling the messiest of operations into profitable, smooth-running machines,” something the Duchess of Cambridge does particularly well. Seriously, she manages to be one of the hardest working members of the royal family, all while being a full-time mother to three young kids.

### 6. MEGHAN MARKLE
Zodiac sign: Leo

Markle is a Los Angeles-born actress: a lover of the limelight and natural-born star. In other words, a Leo if ever there were one. Bold, intelligent and courageous, Horoscope.com calls Leos the “leaders of the Zodiac” and states specifically that they are “ready to blaze a trail and vanquish injustice,” both of which the duchess continues to do.

### 7. PRINCE GEORGE
Zodiac sign: Cancer

Yup, just like his old man. Cancers are typically helpful, emotional and compassionate. According to AstroStyle, they relate to others easily, always looking out for others’ best interests, which are the ideal traits for a big brother.

### 8. PRINCESS CHARLOTTE
Zodiac sign: Taurus

Charlotte is also a strong and confident Taurus who shows many characteristics of the sign. Tauruses are known to be smart and level-headed yet, at times, stubborn. A possible Queen E in the making?

### 9. PRINCE LOUIS
Zodiac sign: Taurus

Like his older sister and great-grandmother, 2-year-old Louis is also a Taurus. And while he still may be too young to figure out exactly how he fits his sign, we imagine he’ll share some of the same traits as his royal predecessors.
